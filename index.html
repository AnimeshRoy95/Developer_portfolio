            <h3>An Industrial Engineer and A Web Development Learner</h3>
            <p>I'm Animesh Roy, completed my bachelor of science in Industrial Engineering. Currently I'm working in a
                Steel manufacturing industry located in Chittagong. I have a fear in programming during my
                undergraduation, but now i feel something necessity inside me to learn programming and that's why
                started learning web developement. Besides, my ambition to get a higher education in a foreign country,
                I believe learning web developement may help me to earn my living.
