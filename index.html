            <h2>Industrial Engineer and Web Development Learner</h2>
            <p>I'm Animesh Roy, completed my bachelor of science in Industrial Engineering. Currently I'm working in a
                Steel manufacturing industry located in Chittagong. I have a fear in programming during my
                undergraduation, but now i feel something necessity inside me to learn programming and that's why
                started learning web developement. Besides, my ambition to get a higher education in a foreign country,
                I believe learning web developement may help me to earn my living.

            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h2>Chase My Dream To Become A Web Developer</h2>
            <p>From the very beginning of my childhood, I dreamt to be an engineer. To achieve my dream I worked hard
                and admitted into a reknowned university in Bangladesh. I started my bachelor in Industrial and
                Production Engineering. Later I dream to become an Web developer. From a social media post I came to
                learn that Mr. Jhankar Mahabub sir started to teach Web Developement. Then I decided to learn from him.
